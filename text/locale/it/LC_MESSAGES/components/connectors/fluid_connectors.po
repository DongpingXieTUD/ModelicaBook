"One area that Modelica has been widely used in is the modeling of various "
"types of fluid systems.  We saw in the previous section how to create "
"connectors for various :ref:`simple-domains`.  But what makes Modelica so "
"compelling for fluid systems is the ability to create more complex "
"connectors involving multiple conserved quantities simultaneously.  Such "
"connectors are essential for modeling fluid systems, where a single "
"connector might involve the flow of mass, momentum, energy and/or species.  "
"Such cases require the definition of rich connectors types."

"Modeling of incompressible fluids is very useful in a number of engineering "

"systems, but with some important caveats."

"As we saw in our discussion of :ref:`simple-domains`, we see the familiar "
"pattern of an across variable and a through variable.  In this case the "
"across variable is ``p`` (the pressure) and the through variable is ``q`` "
"(the volumetric flow rate).  But this connector is different from all the "
"previous examples because the ``flow`` variable is **not** the time "
"derivative of a conserved quantity, since volume is not a conserved "

"where :math:`q_1`, :math:`q_2`, :math:`q_3` and :math:`q_1` represent "
"volumetric flow terms (*i.e.,* each has units of :math:`m^3/s`).  In "
"general, this equation does not qualify as a conservation equation because "
"volume is (again, in general) not conserved.  However, if we know that each "
"of these flows is an incompressible fluid, then we can multiply the entire "
"equation by the density of that incompressible fluid, *i.e.,*"

"Now each of these terms has units of :math:`kg/s` which is a conservation "

"Such a connector definition is useful for relatively simple incompressible "

"This connector can be used for **both** incompressible or compressible "
"fluids.  This is because it doesn't make any inherent assumptions about the "
"compressibility of the fluid.  Note that the across variable, ``p``, is "
"still pressure, but the through variable, ``m_dot``, is a mass flow rate.  "
"As such, the through variable conforms to the convention that a through "
"variable should be the time derivative of a conserved quantity (in this "
"case, mass).  So there are no implicit assumptions in this connector, which "
"is why it can be used to model fluid flow of both compressible and "

"So far in this section, we've presented a connector for incompressible fluid"

"There are many applications where the temperature of the working fluid is "
