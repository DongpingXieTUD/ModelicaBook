"So far, all of this appears quite reasonable and, based on our previous "
"discussion on :ref:`polynomial-evaluation`, the implementation of "
"``Quadratic`` isn't likely to hold too many surprises.  However, let's make "
"things a little more complicated. Consider the following model:"

msgid "This model amounts to solving the following equation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/functions/nonlinear.rst:47
msgid ""
"The important difference here is that the left hand side is known and we "
"must compute the value of :math:`y` that satisfies this equation. In other "
"words, instead of evaluating a quadratic polynomial, like we were doing in "
"the previous example, now we have to solve a quadratic equation."

"A model that requires solving a non-linear system of equations is not "
"remarkable by itself.  Modelica compilers are certainly more than capable of"
" recognizing and solving non-linear systems of equations (although these "
"methods usually depend on having a reasonable initial guess in order to "
"converge)."

"However, it turns out that in this case, **the Modelica compiler doesn't "

"this until we saw how the ``Quadratic`` function is implemented:"

"In particular, note the line specifying the ``inverse`` annotation. With "
"this function definition, we not only tell the Modelica compiler how to "
"evaluate the ``Quadratic`` function, but, through the ``inverse`` "
"annotation, we are also indicating that the ``InverseQuadratic`` function "
"should be used to compute ``x`` in terms of ``y``."

msgid "The ``InverseQuadratic`` function is defined as follows:"

msgid ""
"Note that the ``InverseQuadratic`` function computes only the positive root "
"in the quadratic equation.  This can be both a good thing and a bad thing.  "
"By computing only a single root, we avoid the issue of having multiple "
