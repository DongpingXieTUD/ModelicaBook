"In this section, we'll present another model, like the heat transfer model "
"presented :ref:`earlier in this chapter <cooling-revisited>`, that contains "
"time events.  In this case, we'll show how we can simulate the behavior of a"
" switch in the context of an RLC circuit like :ref:`the one presented in the"
" first chapter <elec-example>`. From the examples presented so far, nothing "
"in this model should come as a surprise.  The main motivation for this "
"example is simply to present time events in the context of an electrical "
"model."

"The time event in this model is introduced via an ``if`` expression. The "
"fact that the only time-varying variable in the conditional expression is "
"``time`` means that this will trigger a time event and that the underlying "
"numerical solver will be able to determine *a priori* when the event will "
"occur while integrating the underlying equations."
