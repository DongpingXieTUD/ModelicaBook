"So far, all the examples we've seen have been of a purely continuous nature."
"  This means that there have been no abrupt disturbances in the system.  In "
"this chapter, we'll focus on how to express what we call \"discrete "
"behavior\".  There are a wide variety of different engineering use cases for"
" describing such behavior and we'll explore these through the various "
"examples presented in this chapter."

"Normally, when we talk about discrete behavior we often refer to \"events\"."
"  An event is something that occurs in our system that triggers some kind of"
" discontinuity.  Differential equations normally result in continuous "
"solutions.  But when events occur, they can introduce various kinds of "
"discontinuities."

"The simplest types of events are ones that happen at a particular time.  "
"These are, not surprisingly, called \"time events\".  Because these events "
"are tied to time, we know what time they will occur even before they happen."
"  Examples of time events would be things like changes triggered by some "
"kind of digital clock that is activated at some specified frequency."

"The other type of event we will encounter are so-called \"state events\".  "
"These kinds of events are much trickier to handle.  The reason is that we do"
" not know *a priori* when these events will occur.  Unlike time events, we "
"have to actually wait for some signal in our system to cross some specified "
"threshold.  Generally speaking, we don't know when that crossing will occur."
"  Furthermore, determining the precise moment when the event occurs is "
"somewhat expensive."

"In this chapter, we'll look at examples of both of these kinds of events and"
" the various Modelica language features that can be used to describe when "
"these events occur and how we describe responses to them."
