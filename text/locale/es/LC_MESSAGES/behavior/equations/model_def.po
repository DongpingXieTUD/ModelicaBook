"A ``model`` definition is the most generic type of definition in Modelica.  "
"Later in the book (and even in this chapter), we'll be introducing other "
"types of definitions (*e.g.,* ``record`` definitions) that share the same "
"syntax as a ``model`` definition, but include some restrictions on what the "
"definition is allowed to contain."

"As we saw throughout this chapter, a model definition starts with the "
"``model`` keyword and is followed by a model name (and optionally a model "
"description).  The name of the model must start with a letter and can be "
"followed by any collection of letters, numbers or underscores (``_``)."

msgid ""
"Although not strictly required by the language.  It is a convention that "
"**model names start with an upper case letter**.  Most model developers use "
"the so-called \"camel case\" convention where the first letter of each word "
"in the model name is upper case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/model_def.rst:32
msgid ""
"The model definition can contain variables and equations (to be discussed "
"shortly).  The end of the model is indicated by the presence of the ``end`` "
"keyword followed by a repetition of the model name. Any text appearing after"
" the sequence ``//`` and until the end of the line or between the delimiters"
" ``/*`` and ``*/`` is considered a comment."

"As we saw in the section on :ref:`avoiding-repetition`, we can reuse code "
"from other models by adding an ``extends`` clause to the model.  It is worth"
" noting that a model definition can include multiple ``extends`` clauses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/model_def.rst:62
msgid ""
"Each ``extends`` clause must include the name of the model being extended "
"from and can be optionally followed by modifications that are applied to the"
" contents of the model being extended from.  In the case of a model "
"definition that inherits from other model definitions, you can think of the "
"general syntax as looking something like this:"

"By convention, ``extends`` clauses are normally listed at the very top of "
"the model definition, before any variables."

"In later chapters, we will show how this same syntax can be used to define "
"other entities besides models.  But for now, we will focus primarily on "
