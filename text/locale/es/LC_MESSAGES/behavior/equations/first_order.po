"This code starts with the keyword ``model`` which is used to indicate the "
"start of the model definition.  The ``model`` keyword is followed by the "
"model name, ``FirstOrder``.  This, in turn, is followed by a declaration of "
"all the variables we are interested in."
msgstr ""

"Since the variable :math:`x` in our equation is clearly meant to be a "
"continuous real valued variable, its declaration in Modelica takes the form "
"``Real x;``.  The ``Real`` type is just one of the types we can use (a more "

"Unlike most programming languages, we don't approach code like this as a "
"\"program\" that can be interpreted as a set of instructions to be executed "

" amounts to solving (usually numerically) the equation and providing a "
"solution trajectory like this:"

"This gives you the first initial hint at one of the compelling aspects about"

"will see that **much of the tedious work involving the solution process is "

msgid "Note the quoted text in this model."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:84
msgid ""
"It is important to understand that the quoted text blocks, called "
"\"strings\" in computer science, are **not** comments.  They are "
"\"descriptive strings\" and, unlike comments, they cannot be added in "
"arbitrary places.  Instead, they can only be inserted in specific places to "
"provide additional documentation about the elements of the model they are "
"associated with."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:90
msgid ""
"For example, the first string \"A simple first order differential equation\""
" is used to describe what this is a model of.  Note how it follows the name "
"of the model.  If you wish to include such documentation about the model, it"
" must appear immediately after the model name as shown."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:96
msgid ""
"As we will see later, this kind of documentation can be used by tools in "
"many ways.  For example, when searching for models, a tool may use these "
"descriptive strings when identifying matches.  This text may also be "
"associated with a graphical representation of the models.  And, of course, "
"this kind of documentation is very useful for anybody reading the model."
msgstr ""

"As this example demonstrates, there are other places that the descriptive "

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:112
msgid ""
"As we have seen already, Modelica allows us to describe model behavior in "
"terms of differential equations.  But the initial conditions we choose are "
"just as important as the equations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:116
msgid ""
"For this reason, Modelica also provides constructs for describing the "
"initialization of our system of equations.  For example, if we wanted the "
"initial value of ``x`` in our model to be *2*, we could add an ``initial "
"equation`` section to our model as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:129
msgid ""
"Note that the only difference between this model and the previous one, "
"presented in the section on :ref:`first-order-doc`, is the addition of the "
"``initial equation`` section which contains the equation ``x = 2``.  In the "
"previous example, the initial value of ``x`` at the start of the simulation "
"was unspecified.  Generally speaking, this means that the initial value for "
"``x`` will be the value of its ``start`` attribute (which is zero by "
"default).  However, because each tool uses their own specific algorithms to "
"formulate the final system of equations, it is always best to state initial "
"conditions explicitly, as we have done here.  By adding this equation to the"
" ``initial equation`` section, we are explicitly specifying the initial "
"condition for ``x``."

"The model ``FirstOrderInitial`` shows a typical way of initializing a system"
" by providing explicit initial values for the states of the system.  In "
"fact, a system of differential equations is incomplete without a "
"specification for how the initial conditions are determined. Our "
"``FirstOrderInitial`` model would be represented mathematically as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:156
msgid ""
"However, there are many cases where you want a more sophisticated type of "
"initialization.  An ``initial equation`` section can contain more than just "
"explicit equations for the initial values of the state variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:161
msgid ""
"For example, we might want our initial conditions to be such that the "
"derivative of :math:`x` was zero at the start of the simulation.  In this "
"case, only a bit of trivial algebra is required to realize that this could "
"be accomplished by specifying an initial condition of :math:`x(0)=1`.  "
"However, for more complex systems, it is far from trivial to determine the "
"initial state values that would satisfy such a requirement.  In those cases,"
" it is possible to express the constraint that :math:`\\dot{x}(0)=0` "
"directly in Modelica as follows:"

"As we see from these results, the initial derivative of :math:`x` is zero at"

"influences acting on this system that would disrupt this equilibrium."

"When building a model, the model developer might wish to associate specific "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/first_order.rst:202
msgid ""
"For example, experimental conditions describe information like the start "
"time of the simulation, the stop time, solution tolerance and so on.  This "

"information about how to approach simulating that behavior. Experimental "
"conditions are stored in a model using a specific annotation called the "
"``experiment`` annotation."
