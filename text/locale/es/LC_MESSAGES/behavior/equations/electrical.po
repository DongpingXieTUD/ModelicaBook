"Now that we have determined the equations and variables for this problem, we"

"really look like the circuit components in our :ref:`low-pass-rlc`."

"Here we see that the name of the model is ``RLC1``.  Furthermore, a "

"Each of these lines introduces a physical type that specializes the built-in"

"These ``parameter`` variables represent various physical characteristics (in"

"One thing that distinguishes this example from the previous examples is the "
"fact that it contains more equations.  As with the ``NewtonCooling`` "
"example, we have some equations with expressions on both the left and right "
"hand sides.  We also have a mix of differential equation (ones that include "
"the derivative of a variable) and others that are simply algebraic "

"This further emphasizes the point that in Modelica it is not necessary to "
"put the system of equations into the so-called \"explicit state-space form\""
" required in some modeling environments.  We could, of course, rearrange the"
" equations into a more explicit form like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/electrical.rst:120
msgid ""
"But the important point is that with Modelica, we do not need to perform "
"such manipulations.  Instead, we are free to write the equations in whatever"
" form we chose."

"Ultimately, these equations will probably need to be manipulated into a form"
" like explicit state-space form.  But if such manipulations are necessary, "
"it will be the responsibility of the Modelica compiler, not the model "
"developer, to perform these manipulations.  This eliminates the need for the"
" model developer to deal with this tedious, time consuming and error prone "
"task."

"The ability to keep equations in their \"textbook form\" is important "
"because, as we will show in later sections, we eventually want to get to the"
" point where these equations are \"captured\" in individual components "
"models.  In those cases, we won't know (when we create the component model) "
"exactly what variable each equation will be used to solve for.  Making such "
"manipulations the responsibility of the Modelica compiler not only makes the"
" model development faster and easier, but it dramatically improves the "
"**reusability** of the models."
