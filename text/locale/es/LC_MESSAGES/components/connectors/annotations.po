"When describing the appearance of a Modelica entity, there are two different"
" representations to choose from.  One is called the \"icon\" representation "
"and the other is called the \"diagram\" representation. In Modelica, the "
"icon representation is used when viewing something from the \"outside\".  "
"Generally, the icon includes some distinctive visual representation along "
"with additional information about that entity added via :ref:`substitutions`"
" (which we will be covering shortly)."

"The \"diagram\" representation, on the other hand, is used to represent the "

"A definition's graphical appearance in an \"icon\" layer is specified by the"
" ``Icon`` annotation (briefly touched on in our :ref:`graphical-connectors` "
"discussion earlier).  Not surprisingly, a definition's graphical appearance "
"in the \"diagram\" layer is specified by the ``Diagram`` annotation.  Both "
"of these are annotations that appear directly in the definition and are not "
"associated with existing elements like declarations or ``extends`` clauses."
