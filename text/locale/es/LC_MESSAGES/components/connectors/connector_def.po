"Unlike a ``model`` or ``function``, a ``connector`` is not allowed to "

"In our previous discussion of :ref:`block-connectors`, we showed that "
"variables within a Modelica ``connector`` definition can have a causality "
"associated with them.  If the signal is expected to be computed externally, "
"then the variable should have the ``input`` qualifier associated with it.  "
"If, on the other hand, a signal is expected to be computed internally (and "
"then transmitted to other components), it should have the ``output`` "
"qualifier associated with it."

"In our discussion of :ref:`simple-domains` and :ref:`fluid-connectors`, we "
"saw numerous examples of ``connector`` definitions that included through and"
" across variables.  These variables always occurred in pairs with the "
"through variable being prefixed by the ``flow`` qualifier while the across "
"variable had not qualifier associated with it."

"As we will see in the coming chapters, such connector definitions are very "
"convenient when modeling physical systems because they enable the Modelica "
"compiler to automatically generate conservation equations for networks of "
"components.  Furthermore, they allow quantities like, mass, momentum, "
"energy, charge, species and so on to flow **bi-directionally** through a "
"network."

"A variable in a ``connector`` definition can also have the ``parameter`` "
"qualifier associated with it.  This qualifier means the same thing that it "
"meant when we first discussed :ref:`parameters`, *i.e.,* the value of the "
"variable cannot change during a simulation. A ``parameter`` variable is "
"frequently used in connector definitions to indicate the size of an array "
"contained in the connector."

msgid ""
"It should be noted that a ``connector`` definition can mix causal, acausal "
"and parameter variables all in the same connector.  In fact, a variable in a"
" connector **can itself be a connector** as well.  This richness of "
"expressiveness in Modelica allows users to model a range of different types "
"of interactions and choose, on a variable by variable basis, the semantics "
"that make the most sense for each potential interaction."
