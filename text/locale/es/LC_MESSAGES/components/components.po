"When most people think of Modelica, they think of the component-oriented "
"approach that it enables.  As such, how to build such component models is "
"probably the single most important topic to cover in this book."

"Until now, we've focused primarily on how to describe the mathematical "
"behavior (both continuous and discrete).  Now it is time to understand how "
"that behavior can be wrapped up into reusable component models. The fact "
"that these component models are reusable means that, once written and "
"tested, the same code can be used over and over.  This kind of reuse saves "
"development time, avoids errors and simplifies maintenance."
