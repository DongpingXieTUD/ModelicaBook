"Up to this point, we've used many of the built-in functions in Modelica in "
"previous examples and particularly in our discussion of :ref:`array-"
"functions`.  While Modelica includes an extensive set of functions for many "
"common calculations, users still need the ability to define their own "
"functions.  The process of defining functions is the central topic of this "
"chapter."
