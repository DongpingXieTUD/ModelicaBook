"This book is a bit unusual in the way it is structured.  This is because it "
"is expected that most readers will be reading an HTML version of the book.  "
"As a result, the book makes heavy use of hyperlinking to allow users to "
"explore the contents of the book as best suits their needs.  For the most "
"part, this linking should only enhance eBook versions of the book, but it "
"may not always translate well into a print medium format.  But every attempt"
" has been made to provide a quality result in all supported formats."

"One aspect of the book worth remarking on at this point is the fact that "
"there are a couple of different \"flows\" supported in the book. Overall, "
"the book attempts to present material in a logical order in the progression "
"of chapters shown in the table of contents.  This means that the first few "
"chapters focus on expressing different types of mathematical behavior and "
"deferring discussions about building more structured models (e.g. packages, "
"component models, subsystems, *etc.*) until later.  However, when reading "
"about a particular example, the provided links will make it possible to "
"sidestep this normal flow of topics and simply continue with further "
"expansion on that particular example in subsequent chapters (which introduce"
" additional language features).  Hopefully, this approach enhances the "
"reading experience without disorienting the user."

"Most chapters are organized into three parts.  The first part introduces the"
" topics to be discussed in the chapter.  Next, an extensive set of examples "
"are used to demonstrate the language features relevant to the topics "
"introduced in part one. Note that each example typically introduces a new "
"topic, so it is best to review all the examples to provide the most complete"
" coverage of these topics.  Finally, most chapters include a review of the "
"topics and a summary of any details not found in the examples to provide "
"thorough coverage of the topics."
