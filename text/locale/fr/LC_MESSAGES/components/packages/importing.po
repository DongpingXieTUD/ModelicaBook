"As we saw previously, there are basically three forms of importing. In all "
"cases, the ``import`` statement creates an \"alias\" within the definition "
"that refers to a type defined elsewhere."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/packages/importing.rst:10
msgid ""
"The first form simply imports a definition by its fully qualified name, "
"e.g.:"

#: ../../source/components/packages/importing.rst:17

"The result of such an import is that references to the name ``Temperature`` "
"are mapped to the fully qualified name ``Modelica.SIunits.Temperature``.  In"
" other words, the alias introduced by the ``import`` statement is "
"``Temperature`` and it maps to the definition found at "
"``Modelica.SIunits.Temperature``.  With this form of import, the name of the"
" alias always matches the last element in the name of what is being imported"
" (*e.g.,* ``Temperature``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/packages/importing.rst:26
msgid ""
"In some cases, we want the alias that is introduced to be different from the"
" last element of the imported name.  In this case, we can explicitly "
"introduce an alternative name for the alias, *e.g.,*"
msgstr ""

"After such an import, we can use the alias ``DegK`` to refer to "
"``Modelica.SIunits.Temperature``.  Providing alternative names avoids name "
"collisions or simply makes the model more readable."

"Finally, it is possible to import all definitions within a package into the "
"current scope.  This is done with a wildcard import.  For example, to import"
" all the definitions in the ``Modelica.SIunits`` package, we would use the "
"following ``import`` statement:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/packages/importing.rst:47
msgid ""
"Such an import would create as many aliases as there are definitions in "
"``Modelica.SIunits``.  The only option available is for each alias to be "
"named the same as the definition in the imported package (*i.e.,* it isn't "
"possible to assign an alternative name for the alias)."

"These types of wildcard imports are dangerous because, as mentioned, there "
"is no option to rename a type.  As a consequence, two or more wildcard "
"imports in the same model could create name clashes.  Furthermore, explicit "
"imports (or fully qualified types) make it very easy to backtrack and locate"
" the definition associated with a given type.  Wildcards make this very "
"difficult because it is not clear what types are imported from what "
"packages."
