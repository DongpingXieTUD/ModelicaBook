"When building subsystem models, it is extremely common for a subsystem to "
"contain parameters that it then propagates or cascades down to its "
"components.  For example, consider the following system model used in our "
"discussion of :ref:`rotational-components`:"

"If we wanted to use this model in different contexts where the values of the"
" component parameters, like ``d``, might vary, we could make ``d`` a "
"parameter at the subsystem level and then propagate it down into the "
"hierarchy using a modification.  The result would look something like this:"

"There is one complication here.  It is possible for a user to come along and"
" change the value of ``damper2.d`` instead of modifying the ``d`` parameter "
"in the ``SMD`` model.  To avoid having the ``d`` parameter and the "
"``damper2.d`` parameter from getting out of sync (having different values), "
"we can permanently bind them using the ``final`` qualifier:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/subsystems/propagation.rst:64

"By adding the ``final`` qualifier, we are indicating that it is no longer "
"possible to modify the value of ``damper2.d``.  Any modifications must be "
"made to ``d`` only."

"Giving all of the \"hard-wired\" numerical values in the ``SMD`` model the "
"same treatment, we would end up with a highly reusable model like this:"

"If we wanted to use a specific set of parameter values, we could do it in "
"one of two ways.  One way would be to extend the parameterized model above "
"and include a modification in the ``extends`` statement, *e.g.,*"

msgid ""
"Note that we did not need to include modifications for the values of "
"``phi2_init``, ``w1_init`` and ``w2_init``, since those parameters were "
"declared with default values.  In general, **default values for parameters "
"should only be used when those defaults are reasonable for the vast majority"
" of cases**.  The reason for this is that if a parameter has no default "
"value most Modelica compilers will generate a warning alerting you that a "
"value is required.  But if a default value is there, it will silently use "
"the default value.  If that default value is not reasonable or typical, then"
" you will silently introduce an unreasonable value into your model."

"But returning to the topic of propagation, the other approach that could be "
"used would be to instantiate an instance of the ``SMD`` model and use "
"modifications on the declared variable to specify parameter values, *e.g.,*"
