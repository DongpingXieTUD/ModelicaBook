"The power of packages in Modelica is the ability to take commonly needed "
"types, models, functions, *etc.* and organize them into packages for reuse "
"later by simply referencing them (rather than repeating them).  But there is"
" still a repetition problem if every user is expected to make their own "
"packages of commonly needed definitions.  For this reason, the Modelica "
"Association maintain a package called the Modelica Standard Library.  This "
"library includes definitions that are generally useful to scientists and "
"engineers."

"In this section, we will provide an overview of the Modelica Standard "
"Library so readers are aware of what they can expect to find and utilize "
"from this library.  This is not an exhaustive tour and because the Modelica "
"Standard Library is constantly being updated and improved, it may not "
"reflect the latest version of the library.  But it covers the basics and "
"hopefully providers readers with an understanding of how to locate useful "
