"This kind of power supply works by taking an AC input voltage (120V at "
"60Hz), rectifying it and then passing it through a low-pass filter. If we "
"simulate this model, we see the following voltage across the ``load`` "
"resistor:"

"Note that our target here is an output voltage of 12 volts.  However, the "
"greater the load on the power supply, the lower the quality of the output "
"signal will be.  In this particular simulation, the load is initially zero "
"(because the load connecting the switch to the power supply is open).  But "
"when the switch is closed and current begins to flow through the load (the "
"resistor named ``load``), we start to see some artifact."

"There are a couple of interesting things to note about this model. First, we"
" see the same organizational structure as we have before where parameters "
"and connectors are made ``public`` while the internal components are "
"``protected``.  We can also see the use of the :ref:`dialog-anno` annotation"
" to organize parameters into distinct groupings (in this case, "
"``\"General\"`` and ``\"Transformer\"``).  We can also see the use of the "
"``enable`` annotation in conjunction with ``considerMagnetization`` "
"parameter to selectively expose the ``Lm1`` parameter only in the cases "
"where ``considerMagnetization`` is true."
