"When most people think of Modelica, they think of the component-oriented "
"approach that it enables.  As such, how to build such component models is "
"probably the single most important topic to cover in this book."
msgstr ""
"大多数人眼里的Modelica是一种可以使用面向组件方法的语言。"
"因此，如何建立组件模型就大概是本书所涵盖的最重要的课题了。"

"Until now, we've focused primarily on how to describe the mathematical "
"behavior (both continuous and discrete).  Now it is time to understand how "
"that behavior can be wrapped up into reusable component models. The fact "
"that these component models are reusable means that, once written and "
"tested, the same code can be used over and over.  This kind of reuse saves "
"development time, avoids errors and simplifies maintenance."

"到现在为止，我们主要专注于如何描述（连续和离散的）数学行为。"
"现在是时候了解这种行为怎样可以包装成可重用的组件模型。"
"事实上，这些组件模型可重用意味着，同样的代码在编写和测试后就可以反复使用。"
"这种重用可节省开发时间，避免编程错误，也简化了维护。"
