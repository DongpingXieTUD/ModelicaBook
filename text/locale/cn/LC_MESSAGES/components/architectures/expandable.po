"As we saw in the :ref:`thermal-control` example from this chapter, when "

"正如我们在本章\ :ref:`thermal-control`\ 例子里看到的，要建构一个架构模型时很难定义一个接口去涵盖所有重要配置。"

"In this way, an ``expandable`` connector definition can be \"grown\" to add "
"additional signals not in the original definition.  In this way, any "
"interface definition with an expandable connector has the flexibility to "
"exchange more information than just what was in the initial connector "
"definition.  As we saw in the :ref:`thermal-control` example, this can be "
"very useful when the interface can vary significantly depending on the "
"choice of subsystems."

"By far, the most common use case for expandable connectors is to add "
"additional ``input`` and ``output`` signals to a connector.  This frequently"
" occurs because the information required when pairing controllers up with "
"sensors and actuators can change depending on the implementation details of "
"those subsystems.  For example, an internal combustion engine with cam "
"phasing will require a commanded cam angle from the controller.  But an "
"engine without this feature will not."
msgstr ""
"到目前为止，可扩展连接器最常用的用例是用向连接器添加额外\ ``input``\ 和\ ``output``\ 信号。"
"这通常出现在传感器、执行器这些子系统的实现细节改变时。因为控制器与上述部件配对所需信息会因此而改变。"
"例如，凸轮相位控制的内燃机将需要来自控制器的凸轮角指令值。"
"但是，如果发动机没有这个功能则没有这样的必要。"

"However, the ``expandable`` connector can also be used with acausal sub-"
"connectors to add additional points of physical interaction between "
"subsystems.  For example, one subsystem may not include thermal effects "
"while another one does.  The one that does could include a thermal acausal "
"connector to allow other subsystems to interact thermally with it."

"不过， \ ``expandable``\ 连接器也可以连接非因果的子连接器，以此为子系统附加新的物理相互作用。"
"例如，某些子系统可能不包含热效应，但另一些则包含。"

"Expandable connector definitions define a *minimum* set of variables that "
"should appear on the connector.  It is assumed that all component models "
"will be balanced with respect to those variables in the connector "
"definition.  In addition, additional variables can be added to an "
"``expandable`` connector as long as the overall system model is still "
"balanced.  Expandable connectors are typically used in conjunction with "
"interface definitions to define a minimum interface within an architecture "
"that can be expanded by the choice of implementations."
msgstr ""
"可扩展接口定义规定了连接器所拥有变量的\ *最小*\ 集。"
"使用可扩展接口的前提是，所有元件模型必须让连接器内定义变量数目与方程数目相平衡。"
"此外，附加的变量可以随时添加至\ ``expandable``\ 连接器内。为此，整个系统模型仍要平衡。"
"可扩展连接器一般用于与接口定义共同使用。这样就可以定义架构模型所需最小接口，以便通过选择子系统的不同实现来实现扩展。"
