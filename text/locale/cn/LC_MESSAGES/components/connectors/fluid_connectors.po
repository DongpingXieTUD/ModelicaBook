"One area that Modelica has been widely used in is the modeling of various "
"types of fluid systems.  We saw in the previous section how to create "
"connectors for various :ref:`simple-domains`.  But what makes Modelica so "
"compelling for fluid systems is the ability to create more complex "
"connectors involving multiple conserved quantities simultaneously.  Such "
"connectors are essential for modeling fluid systems, where a single "
"connector might involve the flow of mass, momentum, energy and/or species.  "
"Such cases require the definition of rich connectors types."

"其中一个广泛使用Modelica的领域是各种类型流体系统的建模。"
"我们在上一节看到了如何为各种\ :ref:`simple-domains`\ 创建连接器。"
"但是，Modelica在流体系统建模里如此引人注目是事出有因的。那就是其创建同时涉及多个守恒量的复杂连接器的能力。"
"这样复杂连接器在建模流体系统时必不可少。在这样的一个连接器内可能涉及到质量、动量、能量和/或介质类型的流动。"
"这样的情况下连接器定义需要支持很多的功能。"
