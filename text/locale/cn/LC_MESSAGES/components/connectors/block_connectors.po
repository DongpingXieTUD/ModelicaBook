"So far, all the connectors that have been presented have been acausal. This "
"means that they consist of pairs of through and across variables. Such "
"connectors are the basis for modeling physical interactions (ones where "
"conserved quantities are exchanged between components).  But there are other"
" types of interactions and other modeling formalisms that can be represented"
" in Modelica."
msgstr ""
"到目前为止，所有前述的连接器均为非因果性的。"
"这意味着它们均是由穿越变量以及横跨变量组成的。"
"这样的连接器是建模物理相互作用（组件之间进行守恒量交换）的基础。"
"Modelica也可以建模其他类型的相互作用，以及使用其他的建模方式。"

"Block connectors are used to model the flow of information through a system."
"  Here we are not concerned with physical quantities, like current, which "
"might flow in one direction for a while and then reverse direction.  Here we"
" will consider how to model signals where some components produce "
"information and others consume it (and then, in turn, produce other "
"information).  In this kind of situation, we frequently refer to such "
"signals as \"input signals\" and \"output signals\"."
msgstr ""
"框图连接器用于建模系统的信息流。"
"在这里，我们不关心例如电流这种流向有时正向、有时反向的物理量。"
"相反，我们只会考虑如何对信号进行建模。"
"信号就是系统中的一些组件会产生的信息。然后，另外一些部件则会消费这些信息（并反过来产生其它信息）。"
"在这种情况下，我们一般分别吧这样的信号称为“输入信号”以及“输出信号”。"

"To model such interactions, we can use connector definitions like these:"
msgstr ""
"为了模拟这种相互作用，我们可以使用如下的接口定义："

"It should be pretty obvious from these definitions that, for example, the "
"``BooleanInput`` connector is used to identify a ``Boolean`` input signal "
"and ``RealOutput`` identifies a ``Real`` output signal."
msgstr ""
"很显然，\ ``BooleanInput``\ 连接器表明输入信号为\ ``Boolean``\ 。"
"\ ``RealOutput``\ 则标示\ ``Real``\ 输出信号。"
