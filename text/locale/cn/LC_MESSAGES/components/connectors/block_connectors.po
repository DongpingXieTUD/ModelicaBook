"So far, all the connectors that have been presented have been acausal. This "
"means that they consist of pairs of through and across variables. Such "
"connectors are the basis for modeling physical interactions (ones where "
"conserved quantities are exchanged between components).  But there are other"
" types of interactions and other modeling formalisms that can be represented"
" in Modelica."

"Block connectors are used to model the flow of information through a system."
"  Here we are not concerned with physical quantities, like current, which "
"might flow in one direction for a while and then reverse direction.  Here we"
" will consider how to model signals where some components produce "
"information and others consume it (and then, in turn, produce other "
"information).  In this kind of situation, we frequently refer to such "
"signals as \"input signals\" and \"output signals\"."

"To model such interactions, we can use connector definitions like these:"

"It should be pretty obvious from these definitions that, for example, the "
"``BooleanInput`` connector is used to identify a ``Boolean`` input signal "
"and ``RealOutput`` identifies a ``Real`` output signal."
