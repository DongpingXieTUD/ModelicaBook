"Until now, we've discussed Modelica as a purely textual language.  But the "
"reality is that Modelica models are primarily built **graphically**.  From "
"this point on, graphics will play a greater and greater role in the way we "
"visualize complex Modelica models."
msgstr ""
"到目前为止，我们讨论过的Modelica是一个纯粹的文本语言。"
"不过实际情况是， Modelica建模一般是\ **图形化**\ 的。"

"This visualization starts with the connectors.  The textual component of the"
" Modelica models will always be present.  Variables and equations will "
"always be declared as we've shown already, in textual form.  But as we will "
"repeatedly see as we move forward, the ``annotation`` feature in Modelica "
"can be used to associate a graphical appearance with many different entities"
" in Modelica."
msgstr ""
"首先我们从连接器的可视化开始。"
"Modelica模型的文本组件将始终存在。"
"变量和方程式将总会像之前一样，用代码形式来表示。"
"不过，我们不断在后面看到Modelica的\ ``annotation``\ 特性是如何将图形化的外观不同的Modelica实体关联在一起。"

"The first kind of graphical association we will introduce will be the "

" a diagram (something we'll discuss in greater detail when we discuss "
":ref:`components`)."

"第一种介绍的图形关联是和\ ``connector``\ 相关的图形。"

"When we associate an annotation with a definition, we place it in the "

"definitions:"

"当我们的将标注和定义相关联时，我们其实是将其放置在定义内。"
"但标注不会和定义内的任何声明以及其他实体想关联。"

"Note the length of each of these definitions.  The length is due almost "

"discussion on :ref:`simple-domains`."

"请注意这些定义各自的长度。"

"We will be discussing :ref:`graphical-annos` shortly.  But let's take a "
"quick look at what is going on in these definitions.  We can see that the "
"``Icon`` annotation contains another variable ``graphics``.  The "
"``graphics`` variable is assigned a vector of graphical elements.  We see "
"that this vector graphical elements includes an ``Ellipse`` (used to render "
"the circle in the icon), two ``Rectangle`` elements (used to render the "
"\"+\" sign) and a ``Text`` element.  Note the ``textString`` field in the "
"``Text`` element contains ``\"%name\"``.  There are a number of substitution"
" patterns that can appear in a graphical annotation.  This particular one "
"will be filled in with the instance name whenever a variable is declared "
"with the type ``PositivePin``. So, for example, the following declarations:"
msgstr ""
"我们很快将要讨论\ :ref:`graphical-annos`\ 。"
"但是，让我们快速浏览下这些定义是怎么回事。"
"我们可以看到，\ ``Icon``\ 注释包含另一个变量\ ``graphics``\ 。"
"\ ``graphics``\ 变量的赋值是一系列图形元素组成的向量。"
"我们看到，这些矢量图形元素包括\ ``Ellipse``\ （用于呈现在图标的圆圈），两个\ ``Rectangle``\ 元素（用于渲染“+”号）和\ ``Text``\ 元素。"
"注意，\ ``Text``\ 内的元素\ ``textString``\ 包含了\ ``\"%name\"``\ 代码。"
"图形注释中能填入不同的替换字符串。"
"上述的替换字符串则指代\ ``PositivePin``\ 类型声明变量的实例名称。"
"因此，例如下面的声明："

"would be rendered graphically with ``%name`` replaced with ``p``.  In this "
"way, the textual names assigned to connectors in a diagram always match the "
"name of the underlying connector declarations in a model."
msgstr ""
"在图形界面里\ ``%name``\ 会表示为\ ``p``\ 。"
"这样，在图表层中连接器显示的文本名称总是匹配于模型里相应连接器声明的名称。"

":ref:`graphical-annos` will be reviewed in detail later in this chapter and "

"本章后面会复习关于\ :ref:`graphical-annos`\ 的内容。"
"而我们也会更多地看到使用图形标注的模型。因为我们会从纯代码模型过渡为包含图形渲染的实现。"
