"In our previous discussion of :ref:`block-connectors`, we showed that "
"variables within a Modelica ``connector`` definition can have a causality "
"associated with them.  If the signal is expected to be computed externally, "
"then the variable should have the ``input`` qualifier associated with it.  "
"If, on the other hand, a signal is expected to be computed internally (and "
"then transmitted to other components), it should have the ``output`` "
"qualifier associated with it."

"在之前对\ :ref:`block-connectors`\ 的讨论里，我们介绍了Modelica的\ ``connector``\ 定义内的变量可以和因果关系联系起来。"

"As we will see in the coming chapters, such connector definitions are very "
"convenient when modeling physical systems because they enable the Modelica "
"compiler to automatically generate conservation equations for networks of "
"components.  Furthermore, they allow quantities like, mass, momentum, "
"energy, charge, species and so on to flow **bi-directionally** through a "
"network."
msgstr ""
"我们将在接下来的章节中看到，这样的连接器在定义物理系统建模时非常方便。"
"因为这些连接器帮助Modelica语言编译器自动生成组件网络的守恒方程。"
"此外，连接器允许数量等、质量、动量、能量、电荷、介质种类等\ **双向地**\ 流过网络。"

"A variable in a ``connector`` definition can also have the ``parameter`` "

"\ ``connector``\ 定义的变量也可以加入\ ``parameter``\ 限定词。"
"这个限定词和我们第一次讨论\ :ref:`parameters`\ 时意思一样。"

"It should be noted that a ``connector`` definition can mix causal, acausal "
"and parameter variables all in the same connector.  In fact, a variable in a"
" connector **can itself be a connector** as well.  This richness of "
"expressiveness in Modelica allows users to model a range of different types "
"of interactions and choose, on a variable by variable basis, the semantics "
"that make the most sense for each potential interaction."
msgstr ""
"应该指出的是，单个\ ``connector``\ 定义可以都在同一个连接器内混合因果、非因果和参数变量。"
"事实上，连接器的变量\ **本身可以也是一个连接器**\ 。"
"Modelica的丰富表现力允许用户模拟一系列不同类型的相互作用，以及为每个变量选择对潜在相互作用最有意义的语义。"
