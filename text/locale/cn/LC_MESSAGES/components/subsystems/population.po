"In this section, we will once again revisit the Lotka-Volterra models to "
"understand how we can build on the work we've already done of creating "
"reusable component models.  We will now take the next step and create "
"reusable models of individual geographical regions (each with the usual "
"population dynamics) and then connect those geographical regions together "
"with migration models."

"This model looks at the population of both rabbits and foxes in the "
"connected regions and specifies a rate of migration that is proportional to "
"the difference in population between the regions.  In other words, if there "
"are more rabbits in one region than another, the rabbits will move from the "
"more populated region to the less population region.  This is effectively a "
"\"diffusion\" model of migration and does not necessarily have a basis in "
"ecology.  It is introduced simply as an example of how we could add "
"additional effects, on top of those implemented in each region, to change "
"the population dynamics between regions."

"Earlier, we turned the Lotka-Volterra equations into components representing"
" predation, starvation and reproduction.  In this section, we were able to "
"use those component models to build up subsystem models to represent the "
"population dynamics in a particular region and then link those subsystems "
"together into a hierarchical system model that also captured the effects of "
"migration between these distinct regions."
