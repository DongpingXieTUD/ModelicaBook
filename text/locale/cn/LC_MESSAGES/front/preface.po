"This book is a bit unusual in the way it is structured.  This is because it "
"is expected that most readers will be reading an HTML version of the book.  "
"As a result, the book makes heavy use of hyperlinking to allow users to "
"explore the contents of the book as best suits their needs.  For the most "
"part, this linking should only enhance eBook versions of the book, but it "
"may not always translate well into a print medium format.  But every attempt"
" has been made to provide a quality result in all supported formats."

"本书的组织结构有一点特殊。这主要是因为，我预期大部分读者会阅读本书的HTML版本。"
"因此，本书大量使用了超级链接以方便读者查找他们最需要的内容。大多数情"
"况下，链接方便了本书电子版本的阅读。虽然对于出版的纸质版本，链接并不会起到太大作用。"
"但我们已经尽了最大的努力保证所有版本格式的质量。"

"One aspect of the book worth remarking on at this point is the fact that "
"there are a couple of different \"flows\" supported in the book. Overall, "
"the book attempts to present material in a logical order in the progression "
"of chapters shown in the table of contents.  This means that the first few "
"chapters focus on expressing different types of mathematical behavior and "
"deferring discussions about building more structured models (e.g. packages, "
"component models, subsystems, *etc.*) until later.  However, when reading "
"about a particular example, the provided links will make it possible to "
"sidestep this normal flow of topics and simply continue with further "
"expansion on that particular example in subsequent chapters (which introduce"
" additional language features).  Hopefully, this approach enhances the "
"reading experience without disorienting the user."

"本书的价值在于提供了两条不同的学习“路径”。纵观全书，本书试图通"
"过目录中的章节递进关系有逻辑的展现示例材料。即本书前几章主要专注于描述不同元件类型的数学"
"特性，在后面章节中更多的讨论如何搭建模型的结构（例如，包、组件模型、子系统等）。"
"其次，当阅读本书的电子版本时，对于描述的示例，我提供了相关的链接以便绕开正常的章节顺序。读者可以"
"方便的在后续章节中继续阅读当前示例的更多细节（后续章节提供了示例扩展的Modelica语言特性）。"
"我衷心的希望这种编排方法可以提高阅读体验而不会迷惑读者。"

"Most chapters are organized into three parts.  The first part introduces the"
" topics to be discussed in the chapter.  Next, an extensive set of examples "
"are used to demonstrate the language features relevant to the topics "
"introduced in part one. Note that each example typically introduces a new "
"topic, so it is best to review all the examples to provide the most complete"
" coverage of these topics.  Finally, most chapters include a review of the "
"topics and a summary of any details not found in the examples to provide "
"thorough coverage of the topics."

"本书大部分章节分为三个部分。第一部分介绍本章节将要讨论的主题。第二部分通过广泛的示例展现"
"说明第一部分中介绍的Modelica语言相关特性。注意，通常每个示例只涉及一个相关主题。所以，读者最好查看"
"所有示例以获取主题的完整描述。第三部分中，主要对讲述的主题和示例中未展示的细节进行了回"
"顾和总结，以此深入描述讨论的主题。"
