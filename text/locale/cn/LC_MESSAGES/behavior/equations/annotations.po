"Recall in the discussion on :ref:`experimental-conditions` we included "
"information about the simulation start and stop time using an "
"``annotation``.  An ``annotation`` is a way to include information that is "
"not related to the behavior of the model.  In the case of experimental "
"conditions, we injected information about how a particular model should be "
"simulated.  But annotations are used extensively in Modelica to provide all "
"kinds of additional information about models.  For example, as we'll see "
":ref:`later in the book <graphical-annos>`, annotations are used to describe"
" the graphical appearance of components and connectors.  For now, the "
"important thing is to understand that annotations are additional data, above"
" and beyond behavior, that can be \"attached\" to different elements in "
"Modelica."

"在试验条件下，我们可以定义特定模型如何进行仿真的信息。"

"例如，\ :ref:`\ 在后续的章节中\ <graphical-annos>`\ ，我们可以看到标注可以用来描述图形外观组件和连接器。"
