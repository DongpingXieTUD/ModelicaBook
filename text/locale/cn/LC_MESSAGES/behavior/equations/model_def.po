"A ``model`` definition is the most generic type of definition in Modelica.  "
"Later in the book (and even in this chapter), we'll be introducing other "
"types of definitions (*e.g.,* ``record`` definitions) that share the same "
"syntax as a ``model`` definition, but include some restrictions on what the "
"definition is allowed to contain."
msgstr ""
"\ ``model``\ 定义是Modelica语言中最通用的定义方式。"
"稍后在本书中（或者在本章中）将会介绍其他的定义方式（例如：\ ``record``\ 定义）这些定义方式和\ ``model``\ 定义有着相同的语法结构，但在其包含的内容方面有所限制。"

"As we saw throughout this chapter, a model definition starts with the "
"``model`` keyword and is followed by a model name (and optionally a model "
"description).  The name of the model must start with a letter and can be "
"followed by any collection of letters, numbers or underscores (``_``)."
msgstr ""

"Although not strictly required by the language.  It is a convention that "

"the so-called \"camel case\" convention where the first letter of each word "
"in the model name is upper case."
msgstr ""
"尽管Modelica语言并没有对此进行严格要求，但一般约定模型名字以大写字母开头。大多数开发者使用所谓的“驼峰式”规则，即模型内每个单词首字母为大写"

"The model definition can contain variables and equations (to be discussed "
"shortly).  The end of the model is indicated by the presence of the ``end`` "
"keyword followed by a repetition of the model name. Any text appearing after"
" the sequence ``//`` and until the end of the line or between the delimiters"
" ``/*`` and ``*/`` is considered a comment."

"模型定义包含变量和方程（稍后讨论）。\ ``end``\ 关键词以及紧随的模型名字的重复出现标志着模型的结束。\ ``//``\ 之后直至该行结束出现的任何文本，以及在分隔符\ ``/*``\ 和 ``*/``\ 之间的文本都是模型的注释。"

"As we saw in the section on :ref:`avoiding-repetition`, we can reuse code "

msgstr "正如我们在\ :ref:`avoiding-repetition`\ 这个部分提到的一样，我们可以在当前模型中添加\ ``extends``\ 子句，以此使用其他模型中的代码。"

"Each ``extends`` clause must include the name of the model being extended "

"general syntax as looking something like this:"
