"A ``model`` definition is the most generic type of definition in Modelica.  "
"Later in the book (and even in this chapter), we'll be introducing other "
"types of definitions (*e.g.,* ``record`` definitions) that share the same "
"syntax as a ``model`` definition, but include some restrictions on what the "
"definition is allowed to contain."
msgstr ""
"模型定义是Modelica语言中最通用的定义方式"
"稍后在本书中（或者在本章中）将会介绍其他的定义方式（例如：档案定义）"
"这些定义方式和模型定义享有相同的语法结构，但是在包含的内容方面有所受限"

"As we saw throughout this chapter, a model definition starts with the "
"``model`` keyword and is followed by a model name (and optionally a model "
"description).  The name of the model must start with a letter and can be "
"followed by any collection of letters, numbers or underscores (``_``)."
msgstr ""
"正如我们在本章中看到的，模型定义首先是模型关键词，其次是模型的名字（或者是模型的描述）"
"模型的名字必须以字母开头，后面可以是字母、数字或者下划线。"

"Although not strictly required by the language.  It is a convention that "
"**model names start with an upper case letter**.  Most model developers use "
"the so-called \"camel case\" convention where the first letter of each word "
"in the model name is upper case."
msgstr ""
"尽管Modelica语言不是一种严格要求的语言，但是还是约定模型名字以大写字母开头"
"大多数开发者使用所谓的“驼峰式”规则，即模型名字的首字母是大写字母"
#: ../../source/behavior/equations/model_def.rst:32
msgid ""
"The model definition can contain variables and equations (to be discussed "
"shortly).  The end of the model is indicated by the presence of the ``end`` "
"keyword followed by a repetition of the model name. Any text appearing after"
" the sequence ``//`` and until the end of the line or between the delimiters"
" ``/*`` and ``*/`` is considered a comment."
msgstr ""
"模型定义包含变量和方程（稍后讨论）"
"模型的结束是以模型名字的重复出现作为标志的"
"在//之后可以出现任何文本，直到本行结束；在分隔符/*和*/之间的是关于模型的描述"

"As we saw in the section on :ref:`avoiding-repetition`, we can reuse code "
"from other models by adding an ``extends`` clause to the model.  It is worth"
" noting that a model definition can include multiple ``extends`` clauses."
msgstr ""
"正如我们在避免重复这个部分提到的一样，我们可以在当前模型中添加扩展条来使用其他模型中的代码"
"并且值得注意的是，模型定义中可以包含多个扩展条"
#: ../../source/behavior/equations/model_def.rst:62
msgid ""
"Each ``extends`` clause must include the name of the model being extended "
"from and can be optionally followed by modifications that are applied to the"
" contents of the model being extended from.  In the case of a model "
"definition that inherits from other model definitions, you can think of the "
"general syntax as looking something like this:"
msgstr ""
"每个扩展条必须包含被引用模型的名字"
"它可以随意的跟随被引用模型的修改而修改"
"在一个由其他模型继承过来的模型定义中，可以看到如下的通用语法"

"By convention, ``extends`` clauses are normally listed at the very top of "
