"At the start of this book, we looked at how to write equations and transform"
" those into simulations.  That, by itself, is very interesting because we "
"were able to avoid having to worry about how we would solve the resulting "
"linear and non-linear systems of equations or how to integrate the resulting"
" differential equations.  However, writing complex systems in terms of "
"individual equations does not scale well."

"So, we then explored the features of Modelica that allow us to create "
"component models so that we could reuse these equations without having to "
"take the time to write them out in every context where they would be used.  "
"Not only did this allow us to compose systems from pre-defined (and "
"presumably tested) component models, it also allowed us, through the use of "
"Modelica's standard graphical annotations, to compose and represent systems "
"graphically."

"This too has scalability issues because building complex models strictly "
"from components requires a great deal of dragging, dropping and connecting "
"of components.  Furthermore, system models can become large and complex "
"without any kind of hierarchy.  This is yet another limitation to "
"scalability.  To address this issue, we examined how to define reusable "
"subsystem models that, instead of containing equations to be reused, "
"contained reusable assemblies of components and other subsystems.  In this "
"way, we could drag, drop and connect common assemblies of components into "
"reusable assemblies.  This minimized the amount of dragging, dropping and "
"connecting that was required to build complex system models."

"Each step in this progression has shown how to reduce the amount of tedious,"
" time consuming and potentially error prone work we need to perform in order"
" to build system models.  This chapter represents the last step along this "
"progression.  Here, we will learn about architectures.  Architectures are "
"models where a collection of subsystems have been **pre-connected** and the "
"composition of the system is done by simply selecting specific "
"implementations (models) for each subsystem in our system.  In this way, not"
" only do we not need to supply equations, we don't even need to drag, drop "
"and connect components or subsystems.  Instead, we only need to choose the "
"specific model to use for each particular subsystem."
